## 🐶 Dog Vision: Dog Breed Classification with Deep Learning

This project builds an **end-to-end deep learning model** to classify over **120 different dog breeds** from images using **TensorFlow 2.x** and **TensorFlow Hub**. It was inspired by the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification).

---

### 📌 Problem Statement

> Given an image of a dog, identify its breed from 120 possible classes using a deep learning model.

---

### 🔍 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition:

* Over **10,000+ labeled images**
* 120 unique dog breeds
* Training and test image sets
